<p><br /><span>Among all the pages of an online shop, the checkout is indeed the most important. This is why it is crucial to create this page strategically, and to optimise it constantly, to make sure that the checkout process is as smooth as possible. Remember that the aim of every online shop is to sell: the more you provide a high quality customer experience and the more your shop will perform.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>In other words, these are the main characteristics that every good checkout process should have:</span><br /><span>1) Great usability: clear layout, breadcrumb on the top of the page indicating all the steps of the checkout, so that the customer can have a perception of how long is going to take.</span><br /><span>2) No distractions. Postpone any possible marketing call to action in the thank you page or before the checkout.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>3) Address form and Payment Methods. Make sure that you have as many payment methods as possible and that all the official logos are well displayed so that the customer can trust the online shop. Also, make sure that your forms are working perfectly (check that the data validation is enabled on every single field of the form, and a clear error message is displayed).&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Magento One Page Checkout basically will include all these features and even more in a pre-engineered template that you will just need to integrate in your online shop. The page includes the login section (with the possibility to have the guest login), billing and shipping address fields, payment information and checkout, all in one page.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The Magento One Page Checkout has been strategically created to help everyone who is approaching to the world of eCommerce to have a ready made optimised and performing checkout process.</span></p>
